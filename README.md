# QuietHelp

QuietHelp is an AI-powered, privacy-first frontend application designed to enable anonymous reporting and analysis of harassment and safety-related incidents, with a primary focus on women in schools, colleges, and public environments.

The project was developed as part of the **“Frontend Development using AI 2026 Hackathon”**, aligned with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality)**.

## 🎯 Hackathon Alignment

**Hackathon:** Welcome to the Frontend Development using AI 2026 Hackathon  
**SDG Track:** SDG 5 – Gender Equality  
**Selected Problem Statement:**  
**PS 14 – Frontend for AI harassment report analyzer to detect patterns**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many incidents of harassment and unsafe behavior go unreported due to fear, stigma, or lack of trust in formal reporting systems—especially within schools and colleges. This results in a lack of data-driven insights for institutions to identify recurring issues and take preventive action.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

QuietHelp provides:
- An **anonymous reporting interface** to reduce fear of exposure
- **AI-based incident analysis** to classify complaints and assess severity
- A **visual analytics dashboard** to identify trends and patterns
- A **privacy-first design** that avoids personal data collection

The platform is intended as a **support and insight tool**, not a legal enforcement system.
